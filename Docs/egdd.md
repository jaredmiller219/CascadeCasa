# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*For game rules, there will be an onboarding process where a cursor pointer demonstrates how to interact with the game. Players will be asked to try out basic mechanics such as dragging, selecting, and coding with guided prompts. The magic journal will serve as the main narrator for this process, offering encouragement and directing players step-by-step through the tutorial.*

## Presentation of Content

*As the player enters a new room, the magic journal introduces the CSS concept in the form of a spell, using magical language to describe CSS properties (e.g., in the living room, the journal says, "To cast the Flex spell is to move the sofa around"). When players select an item from the bar, the journal opens again with a new concept presented in the same whimsical tone. A revision bar on the left side allows players to review past concepts at any time. The journal also revisits earlier concepts in higher-level rooms for reinforcement.*

## Story (Brief)

*The player has just moved to a new town after graduating college. Upon entering their new home, they discover an old, rusty journal on the doorstep. To their surprise, it transforms into a floating, self-writing magic journal. The landlord is nowhere to be found. As it turns out, the journal belonged to one of the player's ancient ancestor - a powerful magic practitioner who believed a well-decorated home ensured harmony and good fortune. To build a happy future, the player must master ancient "CSS Spells" and restore life and balance to each room in the house through thoughtful, magical design.*

# Assets Needed

## Aethestics

*Cascade Casa is meant to feel magical and cozy way more like a quiet rainy day with a warm hot chocolate than a coding bootcamp. Weâ€™re going for a soft, whimsical vibe that feels more like flipping through a spellbook than writing CSS. The visuals are cartoonish and gentle, with floating journals, glowy accents, and little magical touches that make it feel alive. Instead of feeling like you're solving code problems, it feels like you're decorating a space that means something to you. The music is chill and lowkey, maybe a little lo-fi or soft ambient, just enough to help you relax and get into a creative flow.*

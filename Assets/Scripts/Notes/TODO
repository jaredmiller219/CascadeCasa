BUG: When the challenge is correct and you click the next item, you need to reset the challenge text above the buttons

## All

TODO: Make sure when you click the challanege buttons, that it saves its previous syntax, when you swap to a different button. rather than set back to the one it is initialized as. (it should reset it if you click the reset button though (it already does that part))

TODO: make sure the level end screen shows up when you finish the entire level (once all items in the scroll bar have been completed)

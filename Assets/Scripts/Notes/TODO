## Features

### Level Completion

- TODO: Show level end screen when the entire level is completed.

  1. Colors

## Fixes

### Sounds

- FIXME: Add missing sound effects.

  1. Notepad closing
  2. Selecting options in any dropdown menu
  3. Hovering over options in any dropdown menu
  4. Completing syntax (When showing the checkmark)

### UI

- FIXME: Remember where the user left off.

  1. EXAMPLE: If they go to the level select screen and then decide to enter a new level, only remember the current state of the level (including the code and stuff), otherwise, if they decide to just go back to the same level, rememeber where they left off for the notepad visually (which elements were visible at the time)

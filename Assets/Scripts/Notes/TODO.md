## Features

### Sounds

- FIXME: Add missing sound effects.

  1. Selecting options in any dropdown menu
  2. Hovering over options in any dropdown menu
  3. Completing syntax (When showing the checkmark)

BUGS:

- Click the tutorial, go back to menu, go to level select, then click menu, then click level select again, but now the button says back, it shouldnt take you back to the onboarding level.

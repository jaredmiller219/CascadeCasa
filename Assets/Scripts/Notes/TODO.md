# TODO

## Fixes

- FIXME: If the level is complete and we clicked the level select button from the level complete popup, there shouldn't be a back button on the level select page, instead it should just say Menu and go to the menu in that case.

## Features

### Sounds

- FIXME: Add missing sound effects.

  1. Selecting options in any dropdown menu
  2. Hovering over options in any dropdown menu
  3. Completing syntax (When showing the checkmark)
